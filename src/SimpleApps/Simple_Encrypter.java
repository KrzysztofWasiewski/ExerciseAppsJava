    //encrypt - you write a sentence. app changes it with one of the given algorithms and saves to a file. In second file it saves a key, depending on a algorithm (algotiyhm adds a number,
    // so the key can be recognized).

    //if you want to decrypt a file, you need to pass a key. if the key is correct with the number at the beggining of encrypted message, the reverse algorithm takes place, and the program
    //prints your decrypted message
